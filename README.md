# RNP
Code for our work entitled "Fluorescence microscopy through scattering media with robust matrix factorization"

The example raw images is too big for Github. We uploaded it to FigShare https://figshare.com/articles/figure/Example_data_for_RNP/27984221?file=51034379

All the parameters we used are already preset in the code. If you want to use this code on your own data, feel free to tune the parameters.
