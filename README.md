# RNP
Code for our work entitled "Fluorescence microscopy through scattering media with robust matrix factorization"

The example raw images is too big for Github. We uploaded it to FigShare https://figshare.com/articles/figure/Example_data_for_RNP/27984221?file=51034379

All the parameters we used are already preset in the code. If you want to use this code on your own data, feel free to tune the parameters.

We acknowledge the work "Large field-of-view non-invasive imaging through scattering layers using fluctuating random illumination" published on Nat Comm as we use some functions in their code. If you find our code useful, please cite both two works.

Please contact zgao326 at gatech dot edu if you have any questions about the code.
